# Project-16x16
Looking for a cool project ? well here is a good one !
Project 16x16 is a 2D Platformer game made using java.processing. You can contribute to this project. the goal is to make a cool game in processing together.

## Project progress
The game framework is quite advanced, there is for exemple physics, player movements, a functional level editor, level loading/saving etc... What would need to be added are things like entities, projectiles, zooming and object connections. And if you are not a programmer well... you can still contribute ! You could write the Story, think of some gameplay mechanics and level design etc..

## This is the final result we are aiming for

 * Story and Gameplay

### Programmers
The game is made using the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). The source code of the project is located in `source`. But there are also prototype sketches located in `sketch`.
The project is usign two libraries :

 * `source/libraries/processing.jar`
 * `source/libraries/dm.jar`

To add libraries to your eclipse project, `right click on the SideScroller project folder > Build Path > Add external Archive` and to remove libraries `right click on the SideScroller project folder > Build Path > Configure Build Path`. If you have weird errors, clean your project in `Project > Clean...` or refresh your project by `right click on the SideScroller project folder > Refresh`

#### Why Eclipse ? 
because it is easier to organize a project with multiple files by using packages. The processing IDE does not support that feature *yet?*. 

#### What is processing ?
Processing is a simple java library mainly used to create visual art very easily. [Processing website](https://processing.org)
