Looking for a cool project ? well here is a good one !
Project 16x16 is a 2D Platformer game made using java.processing. You can contribute to this project. the goal is to make a cool game in processing together.

## Progress
The game framework is quite advanced, there is for exemple physics, player movements, a functional level editor, level loading/saving etc... What would need to be added are things like entities, projectiles, zooming and object connections. And if you are not a programmer well... you can still contribute ! You could write the Story, think of some gameplay mechanics and level design etc.. The detailed progress can be found in the [Progress wiki](https://github.com/Stephcraft/Project-16x16/wiki/Progress)
